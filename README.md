# Computer Architecture
This repo consists of the codes developed for the course Computer Architecture

## Homework 3
predictor1.py, predictor2.py, predictor3.py:
Branch predictor codes used to predict whether a branch is taken or not. Write-up can be found in Part B of the pdf "HW3".

## Homework 4
Please check the write-up "HW4" for more context.

## Homework 5
compute_euler.c: This multithreaded C program computes an approximation of e^x using the Taylor series expansion with a specified number of terms and threads, measuring the execution time. The program is repeated in Double and Single Precision and the changes in the computed values are analyzed in the write-up "HW5.pdf".
